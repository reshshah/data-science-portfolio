        **Model Interpretation:**
        - **Coefficients**: The coefficients represent the **estimated impact** of each marketing channel on sales. For example, if the TV_spend coefficient is 0.05, it suggests that for every additional unit spent on TV, sales will increase by 0.05 units, assuming other factors remain constant.
        - **R-squared**: This measures the model's goodness of fit. A higher R-squared (closer to 1) means the model explains a large proportion of the variance in sales.
        - **P-values**: These indicate the statistical significance of each variable. If the p-value is less than 0.05, the variable is statistically significant.
        - **Standard Error**: This measures the variability of the coefficient estimate. A smaller standard error suggests more precise estimates.

        **Lasso Regularization Interpretation:**
        - **Lasso** helps prevent overfitting by shrinking some coefficients to zero. It selects the most important variables and reduces the influence of less relevant ones.
        - The coefficients shown here are the ones **selected by Lasso**, meaning they have the most meaningful impact on sales.
        - A coefficient of zero means that the corresponding marketing channel (e.g., Digital spend) has little to no impact on sales when regularized.
        - Compare the **Lasso coefficients** to the OLS coefficients: if Lasso shrinks a coefficient significantly, it implies the variable was not strongly contributing to the model and might have been overfitting in the original OLS model.

        **Budget Allocation Interpretation:**
        - The model has allocated your marketing budget based on the **relative importance** of each channel's impact on sales.
        - For example, if Lasso assigns a high coefficient to TV_spend, more of the budget should be allocated to TV, as it's the most impactful channel.
        - Use this to **optimize your marketing spend** and focus on the channels that drive the most sales return.
        - Compare these values to historical spending: if youâ€™re already over-allocating to certain channels, consider shifting the budget to others with higher ROI.

        - This is the original OLS model without any regularization.

        - The **baseline model** provides a starting point, but regularization with Lasso typically leads to better performance and avoids overfitting, especially when dealing with highly correlated features.
